            <p>I am a 30 year old mom of two hilariously fun kiddos :) I am a massage therapist, personal trainer and in the process of opening a Wellness Store in my newly expanded spa that offers massage therapy along with infrared "sauna time", assisted stretching and will begin to offer aesthetics starting this summer. I am in school for Biology but no rush, I just love science and one day would like to help diagnose my clients with health issues so that they can begin to properly addresss those issues and improve their overall quality of life. I also intend on running additional businesses and this is where my ability to develop web pages and applications will come in handy. I enjoy painting and art design of many types including interior design and clothing design and I am excited to add web design to my skillset. </p>
